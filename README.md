# Botan

**TODO: Add description**

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed as:

1. Add botan to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

  ```elixir
  def deps do
    [{:botan, "~> 0.0.1"}]
  end
  ```

2. Ensure botan is started before your application:

  ```elixir
  def application do
    [applications: [:botan]]
  end
  ```
